# Face-detection
This project exploits two renowned methods(HOG+SVM,CNN) on six different facial angles for performance evaluation. It was observed that CNN was able to detect faces, irrespective of the face angles and occlusion where as HOG based detector failed in such cases. When evaluated on basis of execution time HOG performed better than CNN.
